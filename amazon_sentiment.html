            <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This tool efficiently processes and analyzes customer reviews from Amazon products. It leverages state-of-the-art sentiment analysis and data processing techniques to parse through vast amounts of text, extracting the most pertinent information and compiling it into an easily digestible format. Amazon now has a tool similar to this where they provide a summary of what the reviews say on the product page. At the time I did the project I don't believe they did.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
            <p>Inputting an Amazon product link into the Python script initiates a process of fetching and analyzing customer reviews, which then creates an informative and detailed report. This report showcases key insights, sentiment scores, and trends drawn from the review data.</p>

            <p>
                This project features advanced sentiment analysis, utilizing NLP techniques to determine the sentiment of user reviews and providing key takeaways along with numeric sentiment score values. It includes insightful data visualization, generating clear and intuitive charts and graphs to represent the data, making overall sentiment trends easy to understand. Additionally, it offers comprehensive reporting by producing detailed PDF reports that summarize findings, complete with visual aids and key takeaways.

        <section id="usage">
            <h2 class="section-title">Usage</h2>
            <p>To generate a report, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Set up your .env file in the project root with your RapidAPI and OpenAI API keys.</li>
                <li>Run the script.</li>
                <li>Enter the Amazon product URL when prompted.</li>
                <li>Enjoy the PDF report, which will be saved in the working directory.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="limitations">
            <h2 class="section-title">Limitations and Scope</h2>
            <p>There are several limitations to this prototype tool:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to rate limits for the API, it currently processes up to 10 pages of reviews (modifiable).</li>
                <li>Specifically made for Amazon products, but could be adapted for other e-commerce sites with altered API utilization.</li>
                <li>Works best for products with a substantial number of reviews.</li>
                <li>Models may inaccurately classify the sentiment of reviews; scores are insightful but not consistently accurate.</li>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a prototype and may not be consistently reproducible due to certain limitations and dependencies.</p>

            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <h3>Report Generation</h3>
            <p>
                For report generation, Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create charts and graphs for visualization. ReportLab was employed to generate the final PDF report, enabling complex layouts and the embedding of visualizations, statistics, and text.
            </p>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The analysis utilized Hugging Face Transformers as the primary tool for sentiment analysis, known for their state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks. TextBlob served as a supplementary tool for aggregate sentiment analysis, providing a polarity score to represent the overall sentiment tone of a text. Additionally, the OpenAI API was leveraged for other NLP tasks, such as summarizing key points from reviews.
