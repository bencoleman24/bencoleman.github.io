            <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project is a web-based application that serves personalized song recommendations to users. Users can select the recommendation model type (e.g., popularity-based, cosine similarity, k-means, neural networks) and input their genre preferences or a song that they want recommendations based on. The system then generates tailored suggestions with corresponding song links, providing a smooth and interactive experience. This website is no longer publicly available due to recent changes with Spotify API :(  check out the demo video at the bottom to see how it used to work.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Features</h2>
            <p>
                The features of the system include the ability to select from four recommendation models, allowing users to tailor their experience. A feedback mechanism is incorporated, enabling users to provide input on the quality of recommendations after viewing them, which helps improve the system over time. Additionally, each song recommendation is accompanied by a Spotify link, allowing users to access the song directly.

        <section id="limitations">
            <h2 class="section-title">Recommendation Limitations</h2>
            <p>The training data for the recommendation models is relatively small (~350k rows) compared to what an extensive Spotify dataset with every song would look like. This limits the potential of the models because it makes it difficult to add quality assurance filters like a minimum view count. Occasionally, songs that are irrelevant or of low quality will be recommended.</p>
            <p>Typically, music recommendation models rely on clustering algorithms that group listeners based on their preferences and suggest songs that similar listeners enjoy. However, I chose a different approach by using audio feature data to recommend songs. While this method might not be the most conventional or ideal, the results are still intriguing and entertaining.</p>
