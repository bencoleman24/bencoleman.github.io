            <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was conducted as part of the Econometrics for Big Data course at UW-Madison in Spring 2023. The goal was to statistically analyze climate change trends, exploring temperature patterns and emissions data over the past 50 years. The project utilized various econometric and statistical techniques to understand the impact and implications of climate change.</p>

            <p>
                This analysis included examining historical temperature data to detect long-term patterns and anomalies. The relationship between emissions and temperature was explored using econometric techniques. Forecasting methods such as Seasonal ARIMA, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Lasso Regression were employed to predict temperature and emissions trends. Finally, model performance was evaluated to determine the most effective predictive methods for climate-related data.
